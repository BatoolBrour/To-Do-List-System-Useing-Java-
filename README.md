# Personal Task Manager

---

## üìñ Project Description
The Personal Task Manager is a simple Java-based application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.  
It allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks, with basic file saving functionality.  

**This project is currently under development .  
The core functionality works, but the User Interface (UI) is still in progress and will be enhanced in future updates.

##  Current Features
-  Add a new task (title, description, due date).  
-  Delete tasks by position.  
-  Update existing tasks (title, description, due date, status).  
- Save tasks to a local file (To Do List.txt).
- Display tasks in the console.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).  
3. Run the UserInterface.java file to launch the JavaFX application.  
   ** ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The UI is still incomplete and currently shows only basic input fields.**  
4. You can also test the logic classes (Task and TaskManager) separately in the console.
